This app was inspired by reddit.com/r/stopdrinking, as the name suggests. /r/sd is a terrific community.

I consider this app open source. You can access the source code here:
https://github.com/zakkhoyt/KnockItOff

Features coming soon:
Log into reddit which will allow you to vote, reply, and other reddit stuff.
Pagination support for reddit content.
Built in real time chat based on CloudKit.
